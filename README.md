# ivy-get-all-sources

Ivy is known for having difficulties with downloading sources, especially those of [transitive dependencies](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY-1003).

This tool attempts to download all Ivy sources in a given Eclipse project.

Has been tested and found to work on Apache Nutch v2.4.
